Clone of GeeksforGeeks desktop view.
Tried my best to clone the desktop view of GeeksforGeeks.
However, there were some functions in the site I was unable to recreate due to time constraints, lack of knowledge, need of JS,etc.
Functions missing: Dropdown menu on the header.
                   Horizontal scroll on sticky header.
                   Video links.
